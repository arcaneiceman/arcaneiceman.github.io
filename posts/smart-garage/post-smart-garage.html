                <p>
                    Tired of clicking the garage remote <i>every single time</i> you enter or leave the house in your
                    car? Haven't got the latest EV that directly integrates
                    with Home Assistant? Invested in a Google/Alexa/Siri controlled garage and now annoyed that you have
                    to ask it to open and close the garage door <i>every time</i>?
                    I was recently lucky enough to be an owner of a place with a garage (yeayüéâ), a first for me but I
                    quickly got tired of fidgeting around for the garage fob remote in the car,
                    and even when I bought myself a Meross/Refoss Smart Garage Controller to be able to open the garage
                    door from my phone or voice, I found myself wondering, why can't it <b><i>just work</b></i>.<br>
                </p>
                <blockquote>Specifically, I want my garage door to open when I get in and start my car, close after I
                    have left and when I arrive back home, I want it to both open so I can park my car inside,
                    and when I have exited my car, close up behind me. </blockquote>

                <h5 style="align-self: left;">Prerequisites</h5>
                <p>Before you start you will need to have setup a few things:</p>
                <p><i class="mdi-navigation-arrow-forward"></i> Your garage must be in range of WiFi. </p>
                <p><i class="mdi-navigation-arrow-forward"></i> This guide assumes you already have Home Assistant
                    set up on your local network because Home Assistant automations will be controlling the garage door
                    opening and closing.
                    If you havent used it, I cannot recommend a home automation platform (and much much more!) more than
                    Home Assistant.
                    Check it out at <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">https://www.home-assistant.io/</a>.</p>
                <p><i class="mdi-navigation-arrow-forward"></i> You'll need a Home Assistant compatible smart garage
                    controller that works with your garage door opener. In my case that was
                    a Refoss Smart Garage Door Opener for my Chamberlain Liftmaster Garage Door Motor, a WiFi based
                    smart switch. You can check
                    Refoss's products at their <a
                        href="https://refoss.net/en-ca/collections/smart-garage-door-opener-1">main
                        store</a> or on <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=refoss+smart+wifi+garage+door+opener&crid=2KDKG9GAPU594&sprefix=refoss+smart+wifi+garage+door+opener">Amazon</a>.
                    You can choose either the standard RSG100 for ~$35 CAD or Apple HomeKit enabled RSG100HK for ~$50
                    CAD.
                    I choose the latter because I wanted to be able to control the garage door locally via HomeKit
                    Integration and because the alternative will
                    depend on the Meross Cloud Platform to function. You can also choose to use a completely different
                    controller as long as its able to control the garage door and be able to tell if the door is open
                    or closed.
                </p>
                <p><i class="mdi-navigation-arrow-forward"></i> Lastly, you'll need the a <a
                        href="https://www.meatpi.com/products/wican">WiCAN device</a>
                    made by <a href="https://www.meatpi.com/home">MeatPi Electronics</a>. WiCAN is an OBD-II WiFi and
                    Bluetooth enabled ESP32 adapter
                    which can both create a WiFi access point or connect to an existing WiFi network which will come in
                    very handy.
                    Check out its <a href="https://www.meatpi.com/products/wican">details here</a>. By virtue of
                    connecting via the OBD-II port,
                    it be plugged in to virtually any car after 1996 and being able to connect to your home's local
                    network allows it to provide Home Assistant
                    with all the information it needs about you vehicle to determine if it should open or close the
                    garage door. This does not
                    even scratch the surface of all the cool stuff the WiCAN can do including providing fuel info and
                    odometer readings and more.

                <h5 style="align-self: left;">WiCAN Setup</h5>
                <p>Lets start by setting up our WiCAN device. First, find your car's OBD-II port and plug the device in.
                    It varies in each car
                    but for mine, it was underneath the steering column on the left side. Once plugged in, it should
                    automatically be in Access Point (AP)
                    mode with an SSID like <b>WiCAN_xxxxxxxxxxxx</b> and a default password like <b>@meatpi#</b>. Once
                    connected to the AP, hop on over to
                    <b>http://192.168.80.1/</b> on your favorite browser and access the device dashboard.
                    Use the <a href="https://www.meatpi.com/products/wican#h.ai5ildxkxroj"> official guide </a> if you
                    are stuck on the previous step.
                </p>
                <p>Switch over to the <b>Settings</b> tab and under <b>AP Config</b> and switch the mode from AP to
                    AP+Station. Add your WiFi settings under the
                    <b>Station Config</b> section and feel free to set a complex password for your AP. We wont be
                    needing to connect to it. Save changes and
                    and let the device reset and connect to your WiFi network. At this point, I highly recommend you
                    give the WiCAN a <b>static IP</b> through your router
                    because that will be required in the next part of the setup. If you do not know how to do this, do
                    include your router make or brand in the search
                    so you can find the guide relevant to your device.
                </p>
                <blockquote>In this configuration, the WiCAN device will always be on and actively drawing a power from
                    your car battery. Its a small
                    device so the power drain is small but not negligible. In my use of the device, even up to a week's
                    gap of not using the car did not impact
                    my battery in any noticeable way. Your mileage may vary but you should probably start and run your
                    car at least once a week in order not drain
                    your battery.
                </blockquote>
                <img src="img/ap-stationmode.png" style="align-self: center;max-width: 80%;" />
                <p>
                    Back on the <b>Status</b> tab, you may have noticed WiCAN giving a reading of the car battery
                    voltage. This is the magic sauce that will let us know
                    when the car is on or off. When off, the voltage will hover around 12.0 - 12.8V but when the car is
                    on and alternator running, the voltage will be 13V
                    or more. Combined with an endpoint at <span
                        class="inline-code">http://[wican-ip]/check_status</span> which we will configure a bit later in
                    the guide,
                    Home Assistant should have a pretty good idea when the car is on and off.
                </p>

                    style="max-height: 600px; border-radius: 15px; align-self: center; max-width: 90%;" />

                <h5 style="align-self: left;">Home Assistant Setup</h5>
                <p>First, we need configure Home Assistant to be able to tell whether the WiCAN device is on connected
                    to our WiFi network or not. We can do this using the
                    <b>Ping (ICMP)</b> platform. Head over to integrations, click on <b>Add Integration</b>, select
                    <b>Ping (ICMP)</b>. Put the static IP for the WiCAN device
                    and enter submit. You should now have an entry for the Ping (ICMP) on the Integration page with the
                    device we just added. Navigate to it and under
                    <b>Integration Entities</b>, click <b>Configure</b>. Set the <b>Consider Home Interval</b> to
                    <b>1</b> because we want Home Assistant to mark this device
                    as not home just 1 second after it disconnects. You can even give your device a name to recognize it
                    more easily. I've named my car Balerion :).
                </p>
                <img src="img/PingIntegration.PNG" style="align-self: center; max-width: 80%; max-height: 500px;" />
                <p>
                    Next, lets configure a REST sensor that will poll the voltage from the WiCAN. Add the following to
                    your <span class="inline-code">configuration.yaml</span> making sure to substitute the
                    <span class="inline-code">WiCAN-Static-IP</span>, <span class="inline-code">Sensor Name</span> and
                    <span class="inline-code">Unique Id</span>
                    placeholders. The value template will ensure that the "V" unit in the json
                    response is removed so Home Assistant can parse the actual value.
                </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <div class="top-bar">
                        <span class="language-label">yaml</span>

                <h6 style="align-self: left;">Garage Door Open Automation</h6>
                <p>
                    At this point we have all that we need to open the the Garage Door, both when you start the car
                    inside your garage and when you return home in your car. We will observe the car battery voltage
                    every 1 second as set by the <b>scan_interval</b> and if the voltage is above a set <b>threshold</b>
                    say 13 volts for a set <b>number of readings</b> say 3 consecutive readings and if the door is
                    currently closed, then open the garage door.
                    We do <i>not</i> however want to use the WiCAN connecting as a trigger due to the security risk it
                    poses. Otherwise, if for whatever reason it disconnects from the router and reconnects again,
                    the garage door will open which would be very dangerous. We will discuss fine tuning the previously
                    mentioned parameters at the end of this guide. When creating this automation, we also want to make
                    sure it runs in <b>single</b> mode and add a timer delay at the end so the automation can be run
                    at most one time in the time delay that is added. Ultimately it will looks similar to the screenshot
                    below.
                </p>
                <img src="img/GarageDoorOpen.PNG" style="align-self: center;max-width: 80%;" />

                <h6 style="align-self: left;">Garage Door Close Automation Setup</h6>
                <p>
                    To create automations to close the garage door, the next logical step would be to flip the
                    previous automations trigger and initiate when the voltage is below our set threshold for a set <b>number of readings</b>. 
                    While this would certainly work, it overlooks a few additional
                    scenarios in which you would not want your garage door closing on you. Imagine if you were to 
                    open the garage door manually to take the garbage out. Because Home Assistant is constantly
                    polling for car battery voltage and the value is currently below the threshold due to car being
                    "Off", the conditions to trigger the automation are met and the garage door will close. Similarly,
                    if your garage door is open and the WiCAN disconnects, the garage door will
                    be triggered to close which is undesirable behavior at best and down right dangerous at worst,
                    especially if you do not have a safety sensor in your garage door motor system. In other words,
                    we need to be able to tell if the car was in the ON state at some point within a specific period of time.
                    Luckily being the awesome platform that Home Assistant is, we can use the <b>history_stats</b>

                <h6 style="align-self: left;">Garage Door Close Automation: Close on Disconnection</h6>
                <p> With this in place, we can now proceed with creating our automations. We have two distinct scenarios
                    and triggers we have to program so lets start with needing the garage door to close
                    when leaving home. The trigger is a simple one: WiCAN device disconnecting from our local WiFi
                    network. We just have to make sure that the car was in an ON state at some point in the <b>timedelta</b>
                    period. I also added a conditional notifications to execute as the last step of the automation
                    which fires off in case the delay period has passed and the door is still not in a closed state. Ensure
                    your automation runs in <b>single</b> mode.
                </p>

                <br>&nbsp;<br>
                <h6 style="align-self: left;">Garage Door Close Automation: Close on Car in Off State</h6>
                <p>
                    The second automation to close the garage door is for the scenario where you arrived back home,
                    parked your car in the garage and have now switched it off. The trigger for this the voltage being below the
                    <b>threshold</b> and we additionally check to make sure once again that the car was in an ON 
                    state at some point in the <b>timedelta</b> period. As an additional safety 
                    condition, we ensure that the trigger <b>from_state</b> was not <i>unavailable</i> which happens
                    if the WiCAN for some reason gets disconnected. Once again, make sure to set your automation running mode
                    to <b>single</b>.

                <h5 style="align-self: left;">Testing and Tweaking Parameters</h5>
                <p>
                    And that's it! With one more Home Assistant restart or configuration update, you should be good to
                    test the system out! If debugging is required, don't forget to use the <b>TRACES</b>. 
                    This system uses a number of parameters for which I chose values that work 
                    for me and they might be different for you. Lets discuss some of them.
                </p>
                <h6 style="align-self: left;">Voltage threshold = [13V]</h6>
                <p>This is the lowest voltage that the WiCAN device can report including and above which, the car is
                    considered to be in the ON state. You may want to adjust this value based on your vehicle and battery.
                    Setting it lower increases the probability of a false positives for the car to be considered ON. Keeping it too high means the 
                    garage door will take more time to open because it takes a few extra seconds for the alternator to 
                    increase the voltage to the threshold value.
                </p>
                <h6 style="align-self: left;">Scan Interval = [1 second]</h6>
                <p> This is the rate of polling Home Assistant will use to check on voltage values from the WiCAN device.
                    1 second is the lowest that a REST sensor can be set and it since the WiCAN device consumes negligible
                    additional energy to respond to the query than it would anyway, I kept this at the minimum.
                </p>
                <h6 style="align-self: left;">Number of Readings = [3 seconds / 3 readings]</h6>
                <p> This value represents the number of consecutive readings above or below the <b>threshold</b> voltage
                    to trigger the automations. I chose 3 readings (1 per second) as a middle ground between making the system too sensitive
                    or take excessively long to trigger.
                </p>
                <h6 style="align-self: left;">Time Delta = [1 minute]</h6>
                <p> This value in minutes is how far back from now Home Assistant should check to see if the car battery voltage
                    reported by the WiCAN device was above <b>threshold</b> and therefore in ON state. This value is needed to ensure
                    that Home Assistant only closes the garage door after the car has <i>recently</i> been on. Increasing it further 
                    would make automations more permissive and trigger the garage door closing at unexpected time after the car has stopped.
                    Reducing it may risk the garage door from not closing if readings in the <b>time delta</b> were anomalously low. 
                    Ensure this value is less than automation <b>delay</b> to ensure that each automation run searches a unique window
                    of voltage readings.
                </p>
                <h6 style="align-self: left;">Delay = [1 minute 30 seconds]</h6>
                <p> This value is the delay added to each automation in combination with the automation mode set to <b>single</b> to 
                    ensure that it can only run once every delay period. Setting this value too low may risk automations for being able to trigger
                    too often causing unexpected behavior. Setting a value too high would mean that in cases you do want it to trigger
                    such as returning home because you forgot something will require extra wait time. Ensure this value is greater
                    than <b>time delta</b> so that each run of the automation checks for non-overlapping time windows for last time the car was
                    in an ON state.
                </p>

                <h5 style="align-self: left;">Actually‚Ñ¢</h5>
                <p>I have tested this system over 3 months and have found it reliable enough to share in this guide. However
                    there have been four instances of arriving home waiting outside the garage where I observed the battery voltage reading has been below
                    <b>threshold</b> even when the car is running. I am not quite sure why the car battery behaved that way but it is rare enough 
                    that I can always use the alternative of using my phone to do so in those rare cases. So 95% of the time, it works every time.
                </p>

                <p>I hope you enjoyed reading this guide and were able to make your own garage Actually‚Ñ¢ smart. As I mentioned previously, 
                    this just scratches the surface of what the WiCAN can do. In a future guide, I will demonstrate how you can track your car's odometer and
                    fuel level. If you enjoyed reading this guide
                    or have an improvement to suggest, drop me a message on LinkedIn or Github! Good luck on the path!
